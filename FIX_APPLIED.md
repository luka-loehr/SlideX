# JSON Parsing Error - FIXED âœ…

## Issue
When trying to create slides, the server was throwing JSON parsing errors:
- "Unexpected end of JSON input"
- "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON"

## Root Cause
The streaming response handler was attempting to parse incomplete JSON. OpenAI's streaming API can split function call arguments across multiple chunks, causing parsing to fail when JSON is incomplete.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Streaming Handler (server.js)
- Improved accumulation of tool call arguments across chunks
- Added proper tracking of tool call IDs
- Only parse JSON when we have complete arguments
- Added better error logging with the problematic JSON

### 2. Enhanced Agent Context (src/agents/AgentContext.jsx)
- Fixed slide indexing to handle out-of-order slide generation
- Added handlers for progress and completion messages
- Improved error handling
- Fixed slide array management

### 3. Improved Chat Interface (src/components/ChatInterface.jsx)
- Added better user guidance in the welcome message
- Shows function call status in the chat
- Improved loading state display

## How to Test

1. **Both servers are now running:**
   - Backend: http://localhost:3000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173

2. **Create a presentation:**
   ```
   Create a presentation about artificial intelligence with 5 slides
   ```

3. **When you see the outline, approve it:**
   ```
   generate
   ```

4. **Watch the slides generate without errors!**

## What You'll See
- No more JSON parsing errors in the console
- Progress messages as each slide generates
- Slides appear in real-time in the preview
- Completion message when all slides are done

## If Issues Persist
- Check browser console for any frontend errors
- Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid
- Try a simpler prompt first

The streaming handler now properly accumulates JSON across chunks before parsing, preventing the parsing errors you encountered.
